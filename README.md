# eCommerce MERN Stack Project

This eCommerce web application was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). The application allows users to browse, search for products, add them to a cart, and make purchases. Admin users can manage product listings, update product details, and handle orders.

## Features

- User Authentication (Register, Login, Logout)
- Product Search and Filter
- Product Management (Admin)

- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database is used to store application data.
- **Mongoose**: MongoDB object modeling tool that provides a schema-based solution to model application data.
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)**: Used for secure user authentication by encoding user data and verifying the identity of users.

### Frontend:
